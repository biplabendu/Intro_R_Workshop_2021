### Biplabendu (Billu) Das
    
I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the parasitic behavioral manipulation lab at [Department of Biology](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/), University of Central Florida. In the lab, we study the enigmatic "zombie ant" fungus _Ophiocordyceps unilateralis_ that infects and manipulates the behavior of the Florida carpenter ants, _Camponotus floridanus_, in a time-of-day specific manner. I am testing the hypothesis that the fungal parasite likely hijacks the biological clock of the host in order to do so. Find more about what we do in the lab [here](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/debekkerlab/).

### Veronica (Vero) Urgiles

I am Vero, I stress too much about everything, even though I win shit ton of grants all the time and have way too many papers. You can read my papers [here](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=nvjFNZ8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

### Leo Ohyama

I am Leo, I don't give a damn about anything, but I will show you some cool R stuff anyway. Also, like Vero, I publish way too much and can't keep track of my papers. So, you can find them [here](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=_x_MH_kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). If you can't reach me on my email, you can always find me on tinder.
